# Tableau Visualizations: CO_2 Emissions and Happiness

The purpose of this repository is to share the link to my Tableau Public visualizations, which include visualizing data on CO_2 emissions taken from the [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/) as well as data on world happiness taken from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) (which is a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHRâ€™s Editorial Board).
